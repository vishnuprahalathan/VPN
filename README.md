## ✅ Steps Performed

1. Signed up for a free ProtonVPN account.
2. Installed the ProtonVPN client on my system.
3. Connected to a free VPN server (Netherlands).
4. Verified IP change using `whatismyipaddress.com`.
5. Confirmed HTTPS encryption via lock icon and DNSLeakTest.
6. Compared browsing speed before and after VPN connection using `speedtest.net`.
7. Collected and documented screenshots as proof.

## 🔐 VPN Protocols & Encryption Explained

- **Encryption**: VPNs use strong encryption protocols like AES-256 to ensure data confidentiality.
- **Common Protocols**:
  - **OpenVPN**: Secure and open-source protocol.
  - **IKEv2/IPSec**: Fast reconnection and good for mobile.
  - **WireGuard**: Modern, lightweight, and fast protocol used by ProtonVPN.
- **Tunneling**: VPNs create encrypted tunnels between the client and server to prevent data interception.

## ⚠️ Limitations of VPNs

- ❌ Cannot provide *complete* anonymity.
- ❌ May slow down internet speed due to encryption overhead.
- ❌ Free VPNs often have bandwidth or server restrictions.
- ❌ Some websites/services (like banking or streaming) may block VPN traffic.
